I would like to see if a workout is checked off much like strength training sessions. So linking to PrescribedCardioSession (option?) might be good

1. Yes that makes sense for prescribed workouts
2. Yes keep it simple and flat
3. For equipment, I'd like to have a predefined list. I think we can be quite exhaustive
4. Yes define standard zones.
4. Yes, I'd like to have an active program for cardio.

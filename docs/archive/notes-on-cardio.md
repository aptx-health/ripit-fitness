You could do both option 1 and 2. Setup default primarys and secondaries but then allow the user to modify and save these to their profile.

UI considerations.. Primary and Secondary appear for logging. There's a "modify fields or Gear button" They can choose fields to add (kind of like my password manager allows different form fields). Then these are saved and used again for the next same exercise. There should also be a reset to default button.

There isn't a prompt. It's just they see the defaults and there's an option to modify. No need for learning! No bundles - that's one more nebulous thing we'd need to define and potentially get wrong.

You're right. Just leave sprint as an intensity. We can skip METs. Pace sounds nice. I'm sure runner's would like it.
